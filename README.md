# Lexical Analyzer
A lexical analyzer, often referred to as a lexer or scanner, is a fundamental component of a compiler or interpreter. 
Its main task is to break down the source code into a sequence of tokens for further processing by the compiler or interpreter.

# Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

# Tokenization: 
The lexical analyzer reads the source code character by character and groups them into meaningful units called tokens. Tokens represent the smallest units of syntax in a programming language, such as keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, and punctuation symbols.

# Classification:
As the lexical analyzer identifies each token, it classifies them into different categories based on predefined rules.
For example, it recognizes keywords like if, while, for, etc., identifiers (variable names), literals (numeric constants, string literals), and operators (+, -, *, /, etc.).

# Error Handling: 
The lexical analyzer also handles lexical errors, such as invalid characters or sequences that do not conform to the language syntax. It may raise appropriate error messages to alert the programmer about the presence of lexical errors.

# Output:
Once the lexical analysis is complete, the lexer generates a stream of tokens, which serves as input for the next phase of the compiler or interpreter, typically the parsing phase.
